# SimplPomApp

## What Is This?

I'll tell ya what m'boy, this is going to be a simple timer application that stays up to date using websockets (because I can).

My goals for this project:
* Implement websockets to provide a subscriber-based pomodoro timer for team use
* Host a simple node express webserver from home on my rPi 2
* Get through the coding as quickly as possible

> NOTE: My first commit is just some rough scaffolding from memory.
> It may or may not be in working condition at that time

## How to Run
* Fork/Download repository
* Open CLI in repositories root directory
* Run command: npm install
* Run command: npm start
* Navigate to localhost:3000 from your web browser

# Enjoy!
